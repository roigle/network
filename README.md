# network
A Twitter-like social network website for making posts and following users.

Once registered, users will be presented with all the posts from all users. From this page they can also create a new post. On the top menu they'll also find a link to see the posts of only the people that they follow.

Users also have profile pages, from where other users can follow and unfollow them. Users can edit their own posts and they can also like/unlike other users' posts.

App done with Django for the backend and JavaScript for the front.

This is the fifth project for CS50 Web Programming with Python and JavaScript. Project finished on December 2021. Full specifications can be found here: https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/4/network/
